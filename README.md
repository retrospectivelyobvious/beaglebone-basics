Intro
----
BeagleBone Basics is a collection of small tools, scripts, and utilities to
help folks get up and running with the BeagleBone platform. The goal is to
eliminate frustration, elucidate some of the more confusing aspects of the
setup/usage process, and overall serve to lower barriers to entry with the
platform.
